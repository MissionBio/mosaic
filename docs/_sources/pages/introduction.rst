Introduction
============

This is a set of tools to analyze DNA and protein data obtained from the Mission Bio tapestri instrument.
It can be used for both secondary and tertiary analysis. Its core idea is to allow convenient handling
and visualization of single-cell data to enable exploratory analysis.
