Getting Started
===============

Loading a sample
----------------

Any .h5 file can be loaded as a :class:`~missionbio.mosaic.sample.Sample` object using:

    >>> import missionbio.mosaic.io as mio
    >>> sample = mio.load('/path/to/h5')
    >>> sample
    <missionbio.mosaic.sample.Sample>

Once the analysis is complete, it can be saved using:

    >>> mio.save(sample, '/path/to/save/h5')

Tutorials
---------

The best way to learn Mosaic is through our Jupyter notebook :ref:`all-vignettes`,
which demonstrate basic tutorials on how to use Mosaic to analyse
DNA + Protein data.
